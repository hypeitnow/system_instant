## What is ZRAM?
ZRAM (formerly known as compcache) is a Linux kernel feature that creates a compressed block device in RAM. It's essentially a compressed RAM disk that can be used as a swap device, offering much faster access times than traditional swap on disk.

## Key Features of ZRAM
- Creates compressed swap space in RAM
- Typically achieves 2:1 to 3:1 compression ratio
- Much faster than disk-based swap
- Reduces I/O operations on SSDs/HDDs
- Lower latency compared to disk swap

## Can ZRAM Coexist with Swapfile?
Yes, ZRAM can absolutely coexist with a traditional swapfile or swap partition. In fact, this combination can provide optimal performance:

1. ZRAM handles immediate swap needs with high speed
2. Swapfile serves as a backup when RAM/ZRAM is exhausted

## Recommended Configuration
For modern systems, a common setup might be:
- ZRAM size: 25% to 50% of RAM
- Swapfile size: Equal to RAM for hibernation support, or 2GB-4GB for general use

## Swappiness Configuration
When using both:
- Set vm.swappiness to 100 for ZRAM priority
- ZRAM will be used first due to higher priority
- Swapfile acts as overflow protection

## Example Configuration
```bash
# Load ZRAM module
modprobe zram

# Configure ZRAM size (example for 8GB RAM)
echo 4G > /sys/block/zram0/disksize

# Keep existing swapfile
# /swapfile  none  swap  defaults  0 0
```
